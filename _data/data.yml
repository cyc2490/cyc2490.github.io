  title: Career Profile
  summary: | 
    Yucheol Cho received his Ph.D. from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST), Daejeon, South Korea, in 2025, under the supervision of Professor [Dae-Shik Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nd-UgBYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) .

    He earned his master's degree in 2020 from KAIST, specializing in first-principles-based semiconductor device simulations. Afterward, he worked at Samsung Electronics for a year until 2021. During his time at Samsung, he developed a strong interest in deep learning, which led him to pursue a Ph.D. in the field of deep learning and machine learning, aiming to become an expert in AI.

    His doctoral research included topics related to data engineering, focusing on data generation, training, and inference. He has a broad interest in various AI-related fields, including multimodal models, knowledge distillation, time series anomaly detection, and deep learning for physics. Currently, he is continuing his career at the Agency for Defense Development (ADD).
